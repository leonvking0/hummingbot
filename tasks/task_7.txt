# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Error Handling and Reconnection Logic
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add comprehensive error handling, rate limit backoff, and automatic reconnection for REST and WebSocket operations.
# Details:
1. Map Backpack API error codes to meaningful exceptions.
2. Add retry wrappers with exponential backoff for REST calls.
3. Implement WebSocket reconnection and heartbeat ping every 30 seconds.
# Test Strategy:
Simulate network drops and rate limit errors using mocks to ensure the connector recovers and logs appropriate warnings.
