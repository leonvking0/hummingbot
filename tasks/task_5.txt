# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Private User Stream Data Source
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Add BackpackAPIUserStreamDataSource to subscribe to authenticated WebSocket channels for order and balance updates.
# Details:
1. Authenticate WebSocket connection using `BackpackAuth` and subscribe to `orders` and `balances` streams.
2. Parse incoming messages to update order states and wallet balances.
3. Handle connection keepalive and reconnection logic with exponential backoff.
# Test Strategy:
Unit test message parsing with recorded WS payloads and verify local state updates when orders are filled or canceled.
