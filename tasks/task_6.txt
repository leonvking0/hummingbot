# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Parse market info to build TradingRule objects and create OrderBookTracker for Backpack markets.
# Details:
1. Fetch `/api/v1/markets` to determine minimum order size, price increments, and trading fees.
2. Build `TradingRule` instances and store them in the exchange class.
3. Implement `BackpackOrderBook` and integrate it with the OrderBookTracker.
# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests verifying trading rule parsing and order book tracker initialization using mocked API responses.
