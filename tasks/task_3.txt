# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Public Order Book Data Source
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement BackpackAPIOrderBookDataSource to provide order book snapshots and incremental updates via WebSocket.
# Details:
1. Create `backpack_api_order_book_data_source.py` handling REST snapshot from `/api/v1/depth` and WS channels `depth.<symbol>` and `trades.<symbol>`.
2. Maintain local order book using `OrderBook` and ensure sequence IDs are handled.
3. Include automatic reconnection and snapshot reload when gaps are detected.
# Test Strategy:
Unit test snapshot retrieval and incremental update merging. Simulate missing updates to verify resubscription and snapshot refresh logic.
